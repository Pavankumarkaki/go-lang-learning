# Go Language Learning Plan

This repository contains a day-wise learning plan for mastering Go programming. Each day covers a specific topic and includes a practical task.

## Day-wise Plan

### Day 1: Introduction to Go & Setup
- What is Go? History, features, and use cases.
- Install Go and set up your environment.
- **Task:** Write a simple "Hello, World!" program.

### Day 2: Basic Syntax & Data Types
- Variables, constants, basic data types (int, float, string, bool).
- **Task:** Create a program that declares variables of different types and prints their values.

### Day 3: Control Structures
- if, else, switch statements.
- **Task:** Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.

### Day 4: Loops
- for loops, range, break, continue.
- **Task:** Print all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3.

### Day 5: Functions
- Defining and calling functions, parameters, return values.
- **Task:** Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.

### Day 6: Arrays & Slices
- Arrays, slices, basic operations.
- **Task:** Write a program to find the largest number in a slice.

### Day 7: Maps
- Creating and using maps, key-value pairs.
- **Task:** Count the frequency of each word in a given string.

### Day 8: Structs
- Defining structs, using structs.
- **Task:** Create a struct for a student and print their details.

### Day 9: Pointers
- Understanding pointers, referencing, dereferencing.
- **Task:** Swap two numbers using pointers.

### Day 10: Methods & Interfaces
- Methods on structs, interfaces, polymorphism.
- **Task:** Implement an interface for geometric shapes (Circle, Rectangle) with an Area method.

### Day 11: Error Handling
- Error types, custom errors, panic, recover.
- **Task:** Write a function that returns an error if a division by zero is attempted.

### Day 12: Packages & Modules
- Importing packages, creating your own package.
- **Task:** Create a custom package for basic math operations and use it in your main program.

### Day 13: File I/O
- Reading from and writing to files.
- **Task:** Write a program to read a text file and count the number of lines.

### Day 14: Concurrency (Goroutines & Channels)
- Goroutines, channels, synchronization.
- **Task:** Write a program that launches multiple goroutines to print numbers concurrently.

### Day 15: Final Project
- Combine concepts learned: structs, slices, maps, file I/O, concurrency.
- **Task:** Build a simple CLI tool that reads student data from a file, processes it, and outputs statistics (average score, highest score, etc.).
